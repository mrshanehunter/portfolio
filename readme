The Portfolio pages for TGFM.

** A porfolio of work with a visual element.  Comprising a landing page, and introduction or about page & a portfolio page.  There is a link 
back to the "the main site" - the portfolio was designed to be stored in a sub-domain.

projectDataFile.js contains an array of objects to store all the data for each brand project to be used across the site.

Two asset files are required for each brand - a logo file & an example of the creative work done - filed in the appropriate folders under "assets".

project.js creates the "Projects" page and the branded buttons that are rendered there, based on the number of objects stored in brandData.

modal.js creates a modal for the user-selected brand and displays relevant information on the company, type of work completed & an image by way of example.

There are three folders in the "assets" folder - one for logos (assetsLogo), one for brand creative (assetsCreative) and the assetsPage folder stores any elements used in the styling of the site (background images etc.)
